The assignment given was to add features that improved the accessibility of the website provided and to give  clean well structured code. 
I addressed the accessibility of the website by adjusting the naviagtion by installing button, including larger, more easily read text by choosing colors that had a less eye-straining contrast. I also made images larger, included alt tags for the images and used lighter colored boxes to hold the infromation the website was delivering.
